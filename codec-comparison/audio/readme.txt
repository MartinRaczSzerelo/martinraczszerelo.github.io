These files have been encoded with FFmpeg (except for HE-AAC files) to different codecs at several bitrates to see the difference between them. Some encoders that are built in can't encode audio at such low bitrates like libmp3lame or FFmpeg's native AAC encoder. However, codecs like Opus, Vorbis or HE-AAC are somewhat designed for low bitrates.

The song I decided to use was Ocean by Seanyy because of its royalty-free nature. The files I provide are available to be listened and used in projects (ones that feature audio and it has to be listened), since the song itself is free to use, as long as it's credited with the following:
