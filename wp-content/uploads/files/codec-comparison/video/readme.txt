These files have been encoded with FFmpeg to different codecs at several bitrates and presets to see the difference between them. All of the encoders were capable of encoding videos at constant bitrates, but each works differently and each delivers a different quality.
For VP9, the only usable encoder I had was the Quick Sync Video hardware encoder.
